# Security Configuration for GitHub Actions

This document outlines the security measures and configurations implemented in the GitHub Actions workflows for the Helpers4 project.

## PR Validation Security (`pr-validation.yml`)

### External Contributor Handling
The workflow implements secure handling of external contributor PRs using `pull_request_target` events:

```yaml
# Security check for external contributors
security-check:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request_target' && github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name != github.repository
  steps:
    - name: Check if PR is from external contributor
      run: |
        echo "::warning::This PR is from an external contributor. Manual review required before running CI."
        echo "::error::External PR detected. Workflow stopped for security."
        exit 1
```

### Permission Scoping
Each job uses minimal required permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  checks: write
  statuses: write
```

### Conditional Job Execution
Jobs only run for trusted sources:

```yaml
if: |
  github.event_name == 'pull_request' || 
  (github.event_name == 'pull_request_target' && github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository)
```

## Security Scanning

### Dependency Vulnerability Audit
Automated scanning using Bun's built-in security audit:

```yaml
- name: Run security audit
  run: |
    echo "Running security audit..."
    bun audit || echo "::warning::Security audit found issues"
```

### Sensitive Data Detection
Pattern matching for common sensitive data:

```yaml
- name: Check for sensitive data
  run: |
    echo "Scanning for potential sensitive data..."
    if grep -r "password\|secret\|token\|key" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.json" helpers/ || true; then
      echo "::warning::Potential sensitive data patterns found. Please review."
    fi
```

## Release Security (`release.yml`)

### GitHub App Authentication
Uses GitHub App tokens instead of personal access tokens:

```yaml
- name: Get GitHub App Token
  id: get_token
  uses: tibdex/github-app-token@v2
  with:
    app_id: ${{ vars.PUSHINATOR_ID }}
    private_key: ${{ secrets.PUSHINATOR_KEY }}
```

### Elevated Permissions
Only granted for trusted release process:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  packages: write
  id-token: write
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Branch Protection
- Main branch requires PR reviews
- No direct pushes to protected branches
- Status checks required before merge

### 2. Secret Management
- All sensitive data stored in GitHub Secrets
- App-based authentication over personal tokens
- Regular rotation of authentication credentials

### 3. Code Isolation
- External PRs run in isolated environment
- No access to secrets for external contributors
- Manual approval required for external PR workflows

### 4. Audit Trail
- All workflow executions logged
- Security events tracked and monitored
- Failed security checks generate alerts

### 5. Dependency Security
- Regular dependency updates via Dependabot
- Automated vulnerability scanning on every PR
- Security alerts for critical vulnerabilities

## Threat Model

### Identified Threats
1. **Malicious External PRs**: Code injection via external contributions
2. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Security issues in third-party packages
3. **Secret Exposure**: Accidental exposure of API keys or tokens
4. **Supply Chain Attacks**: Compromised dependencies or build tools

### Mitigations
1. **External PR Isolation**: Separate handling with manual approval
2. **Automated Scanning**: Continuous monitoring for vulnerabilities
3. **Secret Scoping**: Minimal access and secure storage
4. **Build Verification**: Integrity checks on build outputs

## Incident Response

### Security Alert Handling
1. **Immediate Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
2. **Containment**: Stop affected workflows if necessary
3. **Investigation**: Analyze logs and identify root cause
4. **Remediation**: Apply fixes and security patches
5. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders of resolution

### Emergency Procedures
- Disable workflows via GitHub interface if compromise suspected
- Revoke and rotate all authentication tokens
- Review and audit all recent changes
- Coordinate with GitHub Security team if needed

## Compliance and Monitoring

### Regular Security Reviews
- Monthly review of workflow permissions
- Quarterly audit of dependency vulnerabilities
- Annual security assessment of entire pipeline

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Real-time monitoring of workflow failures
- Security alert notifications via multiple channels
- Automated reporting of security metrics

This security configuration ensures that the GitHub Actions workflows maintain high security standards while enabling efficient development and release processes for the Helpers4 project.
