# Container Setup Script

This script (`setup-container.sh`) is executed automatically when the devcontainer is created, **before** `bun install`.

## 🎯 Purpose

The script handles the initial setup and configuration of the container environment:

- **🔒 Security**: Sets proper permissions for SSH and GPG directories
- **✅ Validation**: Checks that configurations are properly mounted
- **📋 Diagnostics**: Provides helpful status messages during setup
- **🔍 Testing**: Verifies SSH agent and GPG functionality

## 🔧 What it does

1. **SSH Setup**: Creates `~/.ssh` with `700` permissions
2. **GPG Setup**: Sets `700` for `~/.gnupg` directory and `600` for files
3. **Shell History**: Managed automatically by `shell-history-per-project` feature
4. **Environment Check**: Validates SSH_AUTH_SOCK and mounted configurations
5. **Status Report**: Shows what's working and what might need attention

## 📝 Execution Order

```
Container Start → setup-container.sh → bun install → Ready to use
```

## 🚀 First Time Setup

**Shell history is now automatically managed by the devcontainer feature.** No manual setup required!

If you have existing shell history data in `.devcontainer/data/shell/`, you can migrate it to the new location:

```bash
# Optional: Migrate existing history (if present)
mkdir -p /workspaces/.shell-history
cp .devcontainer/data/shell/zsh_history /workspaces/.shell-history/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

## 🛠️ Customization

You can modify this script to add:
- Additional environment setup
- Custom tool installations
- Project-specific configurations
- Development shortcuts

The script is designed to be idempotent and safe to run multiple times.
